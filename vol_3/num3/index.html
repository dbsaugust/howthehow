	<meta name="description" content="Dear one,

If you’re reading this email, that means Ben and I have successfully conned you into celebrating our megalomania. Thank you for indulging us. It’s less than two weeks before August 22 aka the wedding (!) aka LIFT-OFF, and I hope we’re all wrapping up our reading of Ta-Nehisi Coates’s Between The World And Me. Please write your own discussion questions and be prepared to defend their inclusion in the syllabus.

Let’s address some of your concerns:

Where am I going again?
The wedding will be held at my parents’ house, 41 Clover Hill Road, Colts Neck, NJ USA 07722. Their names are Ann and George. You’ll love them, I promise. In the case of EXTREME weather, we’ll be at the Unitarian Universalist Meetinghouse at 1475 West Front Street, Lincroft, NJ USA 07738. I’ll let you know closer to the date if that looks like a real possibility.

How do I get there?

  If you need driving directions to my parents’ house and Google isn’t working for you or if you’d just like me to check your work, you can email me. You can take either Exit 120 or 117 on the Garden State Parkway, if that’s helpful.
  If you’re taking the train from NYC, I need you to email me so we can coordinate pickups from the train station. You’ll want to take the North Jersey Coast Line toward Long Branch or Bayhead from NY Penn Station to Aberdeen / Matawan. You can find schedules at the NJtransit website.
  There’s a helipad at Due Process Stables. Your valet should know how to get from there to my parents’ house, but just in case, here are driving directions.


If you have any questions about how to get to the wedding, please let me know. We’d hate for you to be abducted by crocodiles (or worse!) en route.

What am I forgetting?
Check your smoke detector. Bring a flower for our socialized bouquet. Fight the patriarchy. Call your dentist and make an appointment; your dentist misses your cute little tooth-grimes.

We’re so excited to see you!
